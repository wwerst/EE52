   Revision History
      3/10/11  Glen George       Initial revision.
      3/25/13  Glen George       Made many changes to receive_data() function
                                 to properly process packets and handle a
                                 connection closing.
      3/28/13  Glen George       Improved error handling in the function
                                 tcp_connection_restart().
      3/28/13  Glen George       Added ignore_data() callback function and set
                                 it up in accept_connection() in case a
                                 connection starts sending data too soon.

/*
   have_tcp_connection

   Description:      This function returns TRUE if there is a valid TCP
                     connection.

   Operation:        The connection is first checked to see if it is closed.
                     Then TRUE is returned if the shared variable call_pcb is
                     not NULL and FALSE is returned if it is NULL.

   Arguments:        None.
   Return Value:     (char) - TRUE is returned if there is a valid TCP
                        connection and FALSE is returned otherwise.

   Input:            None.
   Output:           None.

   Error Handling:   None.

   Algorithms:       None.
   Data Structures:  None.

   Shared Variables: call_pcb (accessed) - checked for NULL.

/*
   tcp_connection_status

   Description:      This function returns the current status of the TCP
                     connection.

   Operation:        First the connection is checked to see if it has been
                     closed.  Then the value of the shared variable cur_status
                     is returned.

   Arguments:        None.
   Return Value:     (enum tcp_conn_status) - current status of the TCP
                        connection.

   Input:            None.
   Output:           None.

/*
   tcp_connection_init

   Description:      This function initializes the TCP connection software.

   Operation:        The shared variables are initialized and the LwIP TCP
                     interface is initialized.  Then the interface is
                     restarted.

   Arguments:        None.
   Return Value:     None.

   Input:            None.
   Output:           None.

/*
   tcp_connection_restart

   Description:      This function restarts the TCP connection.  This is
                     useful when the link has changed.  For example, when the
                     IP address is changed.

   Operation:        Any open connections are closed.  Then the status is
                     reset and a listener is setup to listen for incoming
                     calls.

   Arguments:        None.
   Return Value:     None.

   Input:            None.
   Output:           None.

   Error Handling:   If there is an error setting up the listener the
                     process_error function is called with either a
                     NETERR_NOLISTEN or a NETERR_NOBIND error code, depending
                     on the exact error.

   Algorithms:       None.
   Data Structures:  None.

   Shared Variables: call_pcb (changed)     - set to NULL.
                     cur_status (changed)   - set to CALL_NO_CONNECTION.
                     have_rx_data (changed) - set to FALSE.
                     listener (changed)     - initialized.

   check_for_close

   Description:      This function checks if the call connection has been
                     closed (most likely by the remote system) and, if so,
                     cleans up.

   Operation:        The state of the TCP connection is checked and if it is
                     closed, the connection is closed at this end and the
                     shared variables are reset to no call.

   Arguments:        None.
   Return Value:     None.

   Input:            None.
   Output:           None.

   Error Handling:   If there is an error closing the connection, the
                     process_error function is called with the error
                     NETERR_CLOSE.

   Algorithms:       None.
   Data Structures:  None.

   Error Handling:   If there is an error sending the busy or ringing packet,

                                               packet was sent.
                     len (u16_t)             - number of bytes sent (ignored).
   Return Value:     (err_t) - error code for handling the data being sent,
                        always ERR_OK.

   Input:            None.
   Output:           None.

   Error Handling:   If there is an error closing the connection, the
                     process_error function is called with the error
                     NETERR_CLOSE.

   Algorithms:       None.
   Data Structures:  None.

   Shared Variables: None.
