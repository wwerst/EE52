   This file contains the utility functions for dealing with calls for the
   VoIP Telephone Project.  The IP number of the "other end" of the call is
   also defined in this file (locally).  The functions included are:
      call_connected    - has the other end connected with us
      connect_incoming  - connect to an incoming call
      disconnect_call   - end a call
      get_calling_IP    - get the calling IP address (accessor)
      get_calling_name  - get the calling name (accessor)
      incoming_call     - is there an incoming call
      initiate_outgoing - initiate an outgoing call
      process_call      - process a continuing call
      set_calling_IP    - set the calling IP address (mutator)
      set_calling_name  - set the calling name (mutator)
      start_call        - start an outgoing call

   The local functions included are:
      ring_fill - fill buffer with a ring tone
      busy_fill - fill buffer with a busy tone
      sine_wave - get the value of the sine function

   The locally global variable definitions included are:
      calling_IP      - the IP number of the other party
      calling_name    - the name of the other party
      last_status     - the lassed status of call (to find changes in status)
      ring_busy_timer - timer for timing ring and busy tones


   Revision History
      6/3/06   Glen George       Initial revision (only dummy versions of the
                                 functions).
      6/6/06   Glen George       Started filling in real functions.
      6/8/06   Glen George       Continued filling in real functions.
      2/28/11  Glen George       Added call to call_halt() in disconnect_call.
      3/10/11  Glen George       Updated code to use TCP functions to
	                         implement actual calling (major changes).
      3/16/11  Glen George       Fixed some bugs in the ring and busy tone
	                         generation and changed the ring tone to 500
				 Hz modulated by 20 Hz.

   Operation:        A static shared variable is used to keep track of the
                     position in the waveform pattern when the function is
		     called.  The function computes the the waveform pattern
		     and writes it to the buffer.

   Arguments:        p (short int *) - pointer to buffer to be filled with
	                               data.
                     size (int)      - size of the passed buffer.
   Return Value:     None.

   Input:            None.
   Output:           None.

   Error Handling:   None.

   Algorithms:       None.
   Data Structures:  None.

   Shared Variables: ring_busy_timer (changed) - updated on each call.

   sine_wave

   Description:      This function returns the value of a sine wave for the
                     passed angle (units of 360/1024 degrees).  The returned
                     value is 13-bits.

   Operation:        A table is used to lookup the sine wave.  The table only
                     covers one quadrant of the sine wave so the argument is
		     first checked to see which quadrant it is in.

   Arguments:        angle (long int) - angle (units of 360/SIN_RESOLUTION
	                                degrees) for which to find the value
	                                of the sine function.
   Return Value:     (int) - value of the sine function for the passed angle
                        with the maximum amplitude being +/- 4096.

   Input:            None.
   Output:           None.

   Error Handling:   None.

   Algorithms:       None.
   Data Structures:  None.

   Shared Variables: None.
