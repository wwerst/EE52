   This file contains the buffer management functions for dealing with
   incoming and outging data for the VoIP Telephone Project.  The circular
   arrays of buffers are also maintained in this file.  The functions all
   assume the ethernet data is singly buffered and the microphone and speaker
   data is doubly buffered.  The functions included are:
      get_rcv_buffer    - get a buffer to fill with ethernet data
      get_rcv_next_ptr  - get next buffer for ethernet data w/o allocating it
      get_rx_buffer     - get a new buffer to fill with microphone data
      get_rx_next_ptr   - get pointer to next buffer to fill w/o allocating it
      get_tx_buffer     - get a buffer to send to the speaker
      get_tx_next_ptr   - get pointer to next buffer to play w/o freeing it
      get_xmit_buffer   - get a buffer to send over the ethernet
      get_xmit_next_ptr - get next ethernet buffer to send w/o freeing it
      init_buffers      - initialize the buffer functions
      rcv_available     - there is a buffer ready to fill from the ethernet
      reset_rx_buffer   - reset the receive buffers to empty
      reset_tx_buffer   - reset the transmit buffers to empty
      rx_available      - there is a buffer available for microphone data
      tx_available      - there is a buffer available to play
      xmit_available    - there is a buffer ready to send over the ethernet

   The local functions included are:
      none

   The locally global (shared) variable definitions included are:
      rx_buffers - the receive buffer pointers
      rx_current - buffer being filled with microphone data
      rx_next    - next buffer to fill with microphone data
      rx_xmit    - buffer being sent over the ethernet
      tx_buffers - the transmit buffer pointers
      tx_current - buffer being played over the speaker
      tx_next    - next buffer to play over the speaker
      tx_rcv     - buffer being filled with ethernet data


   Revision History
      6/6/06   Glen George       Initial revision.
      5/26/08  Glen George       Updated return types of buffer functions and
	                         types of buffer pointers.
      2/28/11  Glen George       Changed buffers to be short ints (16-bits)
	                         instead of unsigned chars (8-bits).
      3/9/11   Glen George       Added functions get_xmit_next_ptr() and
	                         get_rcv_next_ptr().

   init_buffers

   Description:      This function initializes the transmit and receive
   		     buffers to point to the actual DRAM buffers.  The buffer
		     indices are also reset to the empty state.

   Operation:        The array of buffer pointers is initialized to point to
   		     buffers at the start of DRAM.  The array indices are
		     initialized to no buffers allocated.

   Arguments:        None.
   Return Value:     None.

   Input:            None.
   Output:           None.

   Error Handling:   None.

   Algorithms:       None.
   Data Structures:  None.

   Shared Variables: rx_buffers (changed) - set to point to DRAM.

   rx_available

   Description:      This function returns whether or not there is a buffer

   Description:      This function returns the pointer to the next available

		     available buffer, NULL is returned.

   Operation:        If there is a buffer available, the current buffer index
                     is incremented and the pointer to available buffer is
                     found and returned.  The other buffer indices which track

		     there is a buffer available, TRUE is returned.  A buffer
		     is available if the next buffer (tx_rcv + 1) is not being
		     played (tx_current).

   Operation:        The buffer indices are checked to see if there is a
   		     buffer available for filling with data from the ethernet
		     interface.

   Arguments:        None.
   Return Value:     (int) - TRUE (non-zero) if a buffer is available for
                        filling from the ethernet interface and FALSE (zero)
		        otherwise.

   Input:            None.
   Output:           None.

   Error Handling:   None.

   Algorithms:       None.
   Data Structures:  None.

   Shared Variables: tx_current (accessed) - compared with tx_rcv to check for
   					     available buffers.
		     tx_rcv (accessed)     - compared with tx_current to
		     			     assess buffer availability.

   get_tx_buffer

   Description:      This function returns the pointer to the next available

		     buffered and thus the buffer "two back" must now be free

		     buffer, NULL is returned.

   Operation:        If there is a buffer available, the current buffer index
                     is incremented and the pointer to available buffer is
                     found and returned.  Otherwise NULL is returned.

   Arguments:        None.
   Return Value:     (short int *) - pointer to next available buffer

		        interface).

                     is incremented and the pointer to available buffer is
                     found and returned.  Otherwise NULL is returned.
