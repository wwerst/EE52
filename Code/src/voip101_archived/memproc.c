   This file contains the key processing and general functions for memory
   operations for the VoIP Telephone Project.  These functions are called by
   the main loop of the system.  The functions included are:
      add_memDigit - add a digit to the memory location number
      clear_memLoc - clear the memory location number
      del_memDigit - delete a digit from the memory location number
      init_memory  - initialize the memory system
      recall_mem   - recall the IP address from the current memory location
      save_mem     - save the current IP address to current memory location
      start_memLoc - start entering a memory location number

   The local functions included are:
      none

   The global variable definitions included are:
      memloc     - current memory location
      saved_IPs  - array of saved IP memory addresses
      old_status - status of system before a save or recall operation

   Revision History
      6/3/06   Glen George       Initial revision.
      6/7/06   Glen George       Changed start_memLoc, recall_mem, and
      				 save_mem to remember the state the phone was
				 in before the IP address was saved or
				 recalled and restore that state if necessary.

   init_memory

   Description:      This function initializes the memory system.  It first
                     checks if location 0 has the "magic" value in it.  If so
                     the system is already initialized and there is nothing
                     to do.  If the "magic" value is not at location 0 then it
		     is written there and the other saved memory values are
		     set to 0.  This is done so the memory is maintained
		     between resets, as long as power doesn't fail.

   Arguments:        None.
   Return Value:     None.

   Input:            None.
   Output:           None.

   Error Handling:   None.

   Algorithms:       None.
   Data Structures:  None.

   Shared Variables: saved_IPs (changed) - initialized to all 0's.

/*
   start_memLoc

   Description:      This function handles the start of entering a memory
                     location number.  It first clears the current memory
                     location, then sets the new system status based on the
                     passed key value and returns that status.

   Arguments:        cur_status (enum status) - the current system status.
                     key_value (int)          - value of the input key.
   Return Value:     (enum status) - the new status.

   Input:            None.
   Output:           None.

   Error Handling:   If there is an unexpected passed key value, the error
                     handler is called with the error UNKNOWN_KEYCODE_INIT.

   Algorithms:       None.
   Data Structures:  None.

   Shared Variables: memloc (changed) - set to 0.

/*
   clear_memLoc

   Description:      This function handles the clear key when a memory
                     location number is being input.  It clears the current
		     memory location number, displays the now cleared number,
		     and returns with the system status it was passed.

   Arguments:        cur_status (enum status) - the current system status.
                     key_value (int)          - value of the key that was
                                                input (ignored).
   Return Value:     (enum status) - the new status (same as current status).

   Input:            None.
   Output:           None.

   Error Handling:   None.

   Algorithms:       None.

/*
   add_memDigit

   Description:      This function handles a digit key when a memory location
                     number is being input.  It adds the passed key value to
		     the current value of the memory location number.  If
		     there is an overflow (value larger than MEMORY_SIZE), the
                     error handler is called and the key is ignored.  The
		     function returns with the system status it was passed.

   Arguments:        cur_status (enum status) - the current system status.
                     key_value (int)          - value of the input key.
   Return Value:     (enum status) - the new status (same as current status).

   Input:            None.
   Output:           None.

   Error Handling:   If the input causes the memory location number to be to
                     large (greater than MEMORY_SIZE), the error handler is
		     called with the error MEMORY_ADDRESS_OVERFLOW and the key
		     is ignored.

   Algorithms:       None.
   Data Structures:  None.

   Shared Variables: memloc (changed) - updated to new memory location number
                                        based on the passed key value.

   Limitations:      Does not work for memory sizes greater than 6553.

/*
   del_memDigit

   Description:      This function handles a backspace key when a memory
                     location number is being input.  It removes the last
		     input digit from the current value of the memory location
		     number.  If the current location is zero, it is assumed
		     that there are no more digits in the location number and
		     the error handler is called and the key is ignored.  The
		     function returns with the system status it was passed.

   Arguments:        cur_status (enum status) - the current system status.
                     key_value (int)          - value of the key that was
                                                input (ignored).
   Return Value:     (enum status) - the new status (same as current status).

   Input:            None.
   Output:           None.

   Error Handling:   If the current location number is zero then there are no
		     digits to delete in the location number and the key is
		     ignored and the error handler is called with the error
		     MEMORY_ADDRESS_UNDERFLOW.

   Algorithms:       None.
   Data Structures:  None.

   Shared Variables: memloc (changed) - updated to the new memory location
                                        number by deleting the lowest digit.

/*
   save_mem

   Description:      This function handles the <Send/Enter> key when a memory
                     location is being saved.  If the memory location number
		     is valid, it saves the current IP address (even if it is
		     zero) at that memory location.  If the memory location
		     number is out of range (0 or greater than MEMORY_SIZE),
		     the error handler is called.  The function always returns
		     with the status it had when the save state was entered if
		     there was no error and with the passed state if there was
		     an error.

   Arguments:        cur_status (enum status) - the current system status.
                     key_value (int)          - value of the key that was
                                                input (ignored).
   Return Value:     (enum status) - the new status.

   Input:            None.
   Output:           None.

   Error Handling:   If the current location number is zero or greater than
		     MEMORY_SIZE the key is ignored and the error handler is
		     called with the error BAD_MEMORY_ADDRESS.

   Algorithms:       None.
   Data Structures:  None.

   Shared Variables: memloc (accessed)   - used to index the saved_IPs array.
                     saved_IPs (changed) - current IP address is written to
                                           this array.

/*
   recall_mem

   Description:      This function handles the <Send/Enter> key when a memory
                     location is being recalled.  If the memory location
		     number is valid, it sets the current IP address to the
		     address saved at that memory location.  If the memory
		     location number is out of range (0 or greater than
		     MEMORY_SIZE), the error handler is called.  The function
		     returns with the STAT_RECALLED state if there was no
		     no error and it wasn't in the off-hook state before.  It
		     returns with the passed state if there was an error and
		     with the off-hook state if that's the state it was in
		     before.

   Arguments:        cur_status (enum status) - the current system status.
                     key_value (int)          - value of the key that was
