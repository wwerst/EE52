@@@ Exception Vectors @@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
@
@ Start of the IRQ vector table.  This defines the interrupt hander for each
@ type of interrupt.  Must be at the memory address 0x0 (remapped at boot).
@
@ Exception 	            Description
@
@ Reset 	                Occurs when the processor reset pin is asserted. 
@                           This exception is only expected to occur for 
@                           signalling power-up, or for resetting as if the 
@                           processor has just powered up. A soft reset can be 
@                           done by branching to the reset vector (0x0000).
@
@ Undefined Instruction     Occurs if neither the processor, or any attached 
@                           coprocessor, recognizes the currently executing 
@                           instruction.  Software Interrupt (SWI) This is a 
@                           user-defined synchronous interrupt instruction. It 
@                           allows a program running in User mode, for example, 
@                           to request privileged operations that run in 
@                           Supervisor mode, such as an RTOS function.
@
@ Sofwarte Interrupt        Occurs when the processor generates a software 
@                           interrupt.
@
@ Prefetch Abort            Occurs when the processor attempts to execute an 
@                           instruction that has prefetched from an illegal 
@                           address.  
@
@ Data Abort                Occurs when a data transfer instruction attempts to 
@                           load or store data at an illegal address.
@
@ Vector 6                  Used to specify the number of bytes to download from
@                           and external boot memory into internal SRAM on
@                           reset.
@
@ IRQ                       Occurs when the processor external interrupt request 
@                           pin is asserted (LOW) and the I bit in the CPSR is 
@                           clear.
@
@ FIQ                       Occurs when the processor external fast interrupt 
@                           request pin is asserted (LOW) and the F bit in the 
@                           CPSR is clear.
@
@
@ The format is as follows:
@
@   reset:    Reset vector
@   undef:    Undefine instruction
@   swi:      Software interrupt
@   abort:    Prefect abort

@   btldr:    Defines how much data to download from the boot memory
@   irq:      Normal interrupt (low priority).  Actual ISR address loaded from AIC

_start:

@ In this file you must do the following (at least for now):
@
@   - Switch to the master clock
@
@   - Wait for it to stabilize.  The datasheet tells you how long this will
@     take.  You will need to force your CPU to do no external memory  
@     operations during this time.  There is an easy way to do this, but
@     think about it and only ask me if you still can't come up with anything.
@
@   - Set up the chip selects for SRAM/ROM
@
@   - As you write other functions/code for the various hardware blocks, you
@     will need to initialize them here as well.
